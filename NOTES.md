# Old README

The following is the README from an older version of this lesson. It's got way too much writing and not enough we do/you do, which is why
it was changed. Still it's got some useful info for instructors.

## Begin old README

At this point, we know about React props and how they relate to our component's data.
* The thing is, `props` represent data that will be the same every time our component is rendered. What about data in our application that may change depending on user action?
* That's where `state` comes in.

What's state?

We can get a quick idea by taking a look at [this codepen](https://codepen.io/susir/pen/GWONLp).

Values stored in a component's `state` are mutable attributes.
* `State` is similar to `props`, but *is meant to be changed*.
* Like props, which we access with `this.props.val`, we can access state values using `this.state.val`
* Setting up and modifying `state` is not as straightforward as working with props. Instead, it requires multiple methods - explicitly declaring the mutation and then defining methods to define how to update our state.

Let's modify our `Movie` component to allow us to "like" a movie and keep track of our opinions.

### Initial State

First, now that we're going to have a state, we're going to have an initial value. When working with classes, a good way to make initial values is by creating a constructor: `constructor (props) {}`. Constructors say, "When you create an instance of this class, do this." Without a constructor explicitly defined by us, our components will use the default constructor inherited from the `Component` class. That's why we didn't need a constructor before - we weren't doing anything differently than the normal default for every component.

Like `render`, our constructor will be a method on or `Movie` class.
The first thing we always put in a constructor is a call to `super()`, which says "You should still do the default initialization for this class."

```js
class Movie extends Component {
  constructor (props) {
    super()
  }

  render () {

    const actorJsx = this.props.actors.map(actor => <Actor name={actor} />)

    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{this.props.title}</h1>
        <p>Directed By: {this.props.director}</p>
        <ul>Starring:
          {actorJsx}
        </ul>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

Right now, that constructor doesn't actually do anything. What we need to do is
add some initial state to keep track of whether we like this movie.

```js
class Movie extends Component {
  constructor (props) {
    super()

    this.liked = false
  }

  render () {

    const actorJsx = this.props.actors.map(actor => <Actor name={actor} />)

    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{this.props.title}</h1>
        <p>Directed By: {this.props.director}</p>
        <ul>Starring:
          {actorJsx}
        </ul>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

Let's make sure that initial state is actually working by logging `this.state`
in our `render` method.

Great! Except... nothing has changed. To make this functionality work, we'll
need some way to update the state of our component, and some way to display
whether or not we "like" a movie.

Let's start by adding a "You like this movie!" message to any movie component
where `this.state.liked === true`. To test this message, we could just hard
code `liked` to `true` in the constructor.

### Code-along: Changing State

Ok, we set an initial state, and added some UI to reflect that state. Now,
we'll make that `state` useful and add some dynamic functionality.

We need to set up some sort of **trigger event** to change the `liked` state.

We will create a button that the user can click, which will toggle that
property between `true` and `false`. First, let's create a method on `Movie`
called `toggleLiked`.

```js
toggleLiked () {
  this.setState({ liked: !this.state.liked })
}
```

What's this `this.setState` business? Take a couple minutes to skim [the docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#setstate).

Whenever we run `.setState`, our component calculates the difference or "diff" between the current DOM and the virtual DOM node. Then, it figures out how to update the state of the DOM in as few manipulations as possible; it only replaces the current DOM with parts that have changed.

This is super important! Using React, **we only change parts of the DOM that need to be changed.**

* This has implications for performance.
* We do not re-render the entire component like we have been so far.
* This is one of React's core advantages.


#### Challenge: Count to 10

After 10 clicks, the user should see the counter reset to 1.
